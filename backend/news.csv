<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Penn High School will offer pre-packaged breakfasts. Students will select pre-packaged meal components in the cafeteria.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Penn&nbsp;will also be offering take-home meals for students.&nbsp;The meals will cover the days when students are learning from home.&nbsp;Meals will be given out at the end of the day on Wednesday and Friday at Door L, Door C and the IMC.&nbsp;The package will contain three breakfast and three lunch meals. Items will be frozen if possible and bags will have heating and storage instructions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We will have meals available for the 100 percent virtual learners from all schools and the community. Meals will be distributed at Penn High School Door C from 4-6 p.m. on Wednesday and Friday. It will be the same type of bag with only four meals on Wednesday and six on Friday. Students do not need to be present for the parent or guardian to pick up meals. Student ID&rsquo;s will not be required.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parents who do not want their student to have a free meal may donate the money to our fund for students who do not have money for meals.&nbsp;We are able to do the free meals due to a temporary waiver from the USDA. This will most likely last no longer than this semester. Money currently on student accounts will remain for their later use.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jayden Bell, Sydney Domal, Reagan Hoke, Anna Huber, Maya Kvaratskhelia, Evan Li, Ryan Ludwig, Joseph Radde, Aidan Sweeney, Benjamin VanderVeen and Grace Waddell are among 16,000 high school students nationwide who have the opportunity to compete for some 7,600 National Merit Scholarships worth more than $31 million.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are extremely proud of these students and their accomplishments,&rdquo; Galiher said. &ldquo;This recognition is a culmination of the great efforts of these students, including all the wonderful teachers they have had while attending P-H-M schools.&nbsp; These students represent our vision of excellence and have bright futures.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>More than 1.5 million juniors in 21,000 high schools entered the 2020 National Merit Scholarship Program by taking the Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test. The 16,000 semifinalists represent less than one percent of the United States&rsquo; high school seniors.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Merit Scholars are selected on the basis of their skills, accomplishments and potential for success in rigorous college studies.</p>
